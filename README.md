# CS-300

    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    
In this Course we used the knowledge learned about data structres to determine which would be best for a program that takes in a file as input, can sort the file, and print the contents. It should also be bale to search for items in the file. 

    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    
I started off by learning each data structure for lists such as hash tables and vectors, and what each was best at and then came to the decision to use a hash table in my code. It is important to take each into consideration because of all the functions we need to be able to do such as search threw out the list and print alphabetically.
    
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

My biggest tool in this course was zybooks as my main source of learning about each sturcture. 
    
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This porject has shown there are many different apporaches to the same problem and some can be more effect then others so its important to look at the advantages and disavantages and try not to get stuck just using one way. 
    
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I feel like the quailty of my work has improved class to class as ive started to use more inline comments and try to keep the project clean and to standards. Doing this should be making my work more readable. 

This is a showcase of work in data structures and algorithms.
